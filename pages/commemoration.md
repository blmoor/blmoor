# B.L. Moor Teachers and Administrators

## E.N. Wicks

Reverend Enzell N. ("E.N.") Wicks, Sr., the son Isaac and Lucina Wicks, was a Lowndes County native who graduated from the Ministerial Institute in West Point, Mississippi in 1941 before joining the Army during WWII until being honoraby discharged in 1945. After his military service, he attended Okolona community college before transferring to Tougaloo College where he attained his Bachelor's degree in Biology in 1951. He later earned his MA in School Administration at Tuskegee Instititute in 1961. 

Rev. Wicks started his professional career at Rock Hill in 1953 where he served as a teacher for one year and a principal for six years (1954-1960). He went on to serve as Alexander Junior High's first principal for a year (1960-1961). From here, he went on to serve as B.L. Moor's principal for 21 years from 1961 to 1982, the longest tenure of any B.L. Moor principal. In total, he served Oktibbeha county as a teacher and administrator for 29 consecutive years. During this time, students recall him being a strong and attentive leader who connected with faculty, staff, and students alike. 

Class of '67's Allen Marie S. Landfair describes Wicks as attending sporting events and cheering the players on, saying, "those are my children!" Furthermore, she says he went above and beyond his role as a principal, as he would carry sick students home or to the doctor. Academically, Landfair commends Wicks of his steadfast strength and generosity that prompted both student success and productive members of society in the face of social inequality. And it is for these reasons that Landfair says he was a "friend and much like our father... a good man."

Wicks also served as the president of the Oktibbeha County Association of Educators, the Fifth District Teacher's Association, and the vice-president of the Lowndes County Water Association. He was also a member of the National Association of Educators, Mississippi Associtation of Educators, the Mississippi Teacher's Association, the NAACP. 

In addition to his time at B.L. Moor, he accepted his calling to the ministry in 1968 and served as the pastor for St. James in Crawford, Mississippi for four years and Fourth Street M.B. Church in Columbus, Mississippi between 1976 and 1989.  

Rev. E.N. Wicks passed away in May of 1996 but lives on through his wife, Modess Stanfield Wicks,<!--wonder if this should be revised for longevity--> his eight children, and the numerous individuals he touched while alive.

## Dr. Walter Conley

Dr. Walter Conley was the first Black Superintendent elected by Beat Five voting precinct after he noticed, as a teacher, that B.L. Moor needed better representation amongst the all white office. Conley, a graduate of 1964 - the first full class of B.L. Moor, served 40 years as an educator and 20 years as a superintendent (1988 - 2008) of Oktibbeha County School District.   

After receiving his bachelor's degree in mathematic from Tougaloo College in 1968, Conley began teaching at B.L. Moor until 1977 before going on to earn his master's degree in Mathematics education in 1974 and a doctorates in educational leadership in 1996; both were from Mississippi State University. 

Conley significantly impacted the attitude and accountability of the community, as he improved the schools academically. In example, while superintendent, Conley enabled the establishment of computer labs and computerized libraries, both of which helped improve distant learning capabilities. These enhancements allowed two elementary schools to earn the Achievement Gap Award in 2006-2007, beating out the other 12 schools in Mississippi. Moreover, the district became one of 25 schools in the nation to receive a NASA grant. 

Upon reflection of his career, Conley stated, "One thing I want to make clear - though I have been superintendent for the past 20 years, without the help of the community, none of this would have been possible. It was a team effort."  

## Ms. Emma Conley

Emma Conley began teaching at Austin community school before moving to B.L. Moor in 1960, the year of consolidation. Ms. Conley taught at B.L. Moor for forty years thereafter, two years before the school would see another consolidation into East Oktibbeha County High School (EOCHS).

# B.L. Moor Staff

Educators and administration are often the primary individuals commemorated, but without the staff's consistent help, schools would not be able to operate efficiently and smoothly. These listed are just a few who attributed to B.L. Moor's success. 

Matthew Rice served as the first custodian for many years, and the first secretary, Vivian Curry, served for 34 years and under seven principals. The initial bus drivers consisted of Fred Stallings, Joe Ree Malone, and James Beckum. Annie L. Curry served as the first food services manager and  R.L. Stevenson took her place thereafter.
