# Ongoing Efforts

The Education Association of East Oktibbeha County Schools (EAEOCS) are still making efforts to remain active in the community, despite the consolidation that occurred in 2015 that brought an end to B.L. Moor.

# Reclaiming Efforts

In attempt to fortify themselves as a resource to the community, [EAEOCS](/about-eaeocs.html), on the same day B.L. Moor was officially consolidated - Memorial Day of 2015, decided to advocate for a portion of the existing school building (as seen below) so they could preserve and maintain their history while providing the local community with resources. These resources included educational tutoring and mentoring, health and wellness services, as well as professional development like CV and Resume building. In addition to the educational and career resources, EAEOCS desired a suitable and familiar location where the local community (churches, schools, clubs, etc.) could host gatherings of all types year-round; moreover, sports and recreational events could occur on the property due to the existing fields, furthering their goal to build and strengthen community relationships. As a whole, EAEOCS's effort was expected to provide Oktibbeha County's rural communitiy with resources and services that are limited.

Within three and a half months of the school's official consolidation, EAEOCS had submitted a proposal to Starkville Oktibbeha County School District (SOCSD) about acquiring the land. Initially, the school attorney replied with contract details of how to acquire the location, but once the proposal for the community center was submitted to the Board of Supervisors (BOS), they and SOCSD worked together to nullify EAEOCS's attempts to acquire the land. In January of 2020, after 5 years of mowing and upkeeping the land with the resources available and permitted, EAEOCS received contradictory messages. EAEOCS representative Willie E. Thomas heard from a school superintendent that the plan appeared optmistic and that they were just waiting for the BOS to act; however, Thomas was told by the BOS just days later that the "deal was off" and instructed to return inquiries to SOCSD. EAEOCS continued to try and contact the SOCSD superintendent but never received a reply. 

On October 3rd, 2020, EAEOCS held a public rally <!--more info. attendance numbers? Location?--> to advocate for the community center, but eight days later, the Starkville Board of Trustees agreed to offer a contract to [Wildlife Dominion, LLC.](https://wildlifedominion.com/) for $136,000. On Novemeber 10, the President of BOS, Joe Williams, contacted EAEOCS and told them their requests for a community center had been denied. EAEOCS immediately contacted the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to discuss the SOCSD's failure to communicate with them and the overall unequal opportunity to acquire land. DOJ and EAEOCS proposed to share the building with the Wildlife Dominion but mutliple attempts to reach them proved unsuccessful. 

On July 6th, 2021, EAEOCS continued to question BOS about the school board's compliance with Mississippi laws<!--law/code in question?-->, but they ended up voting 3-2 for the sale of the property, with the two supervisors in opposition suggesting an opinion from the attorney state general. On July 30th, Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) approved the SOCSD to swap 1699 Moor High Road, Section 16 Land, with Wild Life Dominion's other property, granting the school district financial support. 

Today, Wildlife Dominion, LLC remains on the property and is accompanied by other commercial uses such as [The Hill and Moor](https://thehillandmoor.com/) and [The Tangerine](https://thehillandmoor.com/the-tangerine/). The Hill and Moor is a rentable 12,000 square foot venue for weddings, university Greek events, and/or seasonal parties, while The Tangerine is a motel to accomodate to the venue and MSU gameday fans. Although EAEOCS was unable to use a portion of the B.L. Moor building, they were successful in having the [Mississippi Landmark Designation](/accomplishments.html) approved and established, allowing their presence to remain associated with the location that they identify so heavily with, regardless of what occurs on the property.  

# Reunions

EAEOCS has also made conscious efforts of keeping B.L. Moor alumni from 1960 to 2015 connected through reunions regardless of where they are today. Jimmy Blair (Class of '64) ignited the idea in 2006 when he organized a reunion in St. Louis that had approximately 100 attendees. The event provided food and games before making its way to the community center where the event continued. Amid the event, the plan for a more widespread reunion in the following year developed. Hence, in 2007, another reunion occurred across a three day period in which 350 alumni across 15 different states gathered in Starkville. The 2007 reunion saw the formation of a reunion committee who would develop reunions biennially; this committee is now a component of EAEOCS. 

From 2009-2019, the reunions were held at various places, such as the Starkville Shrine Building, EOCHS, Travis Outlaw Center, Starkville Sportplex, and McKee Park. These reunions continue to provide food and games for all, but they also honor former coaches, teachers, and students and have various alumni and administrators ranging across the years speak on behalf of their school experiences.

The reunions have seen different themes through the years, such as "Born to Soar," "Soaring Past, Pressent, and Future," "A Change Has Come," and "Reunited... It Feels So Good."   

In 2023, the reunion was held on June 17th at the Marriot/Mill Conference Center in Starkville. It consisted of a formal dinner and live entertainment, accompanied by videography and photography of a documentary in development. Alumni were able to further share their stories and create better awwareness for the younger generation present. Community leaders also attended, discussing various topics and issues affecting the community at large.
